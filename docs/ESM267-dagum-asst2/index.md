## Land Use in the Osa Peninsula

The Osa Peninsula in Southern Costa Rica is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet, but its species are threatened by habitat fragmentation due to farming and land use change. The Amistosa Ag group project at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management is a team of Masters' students researching wildlife connectivity and the economic benefits of wildlife-friendly farming as a potential solution to produce enough food for the region while conserving important species.

This map displays the study area for the project in the Puntarenas province of Costa Rica. Corcovado National Park, Piedras Blancas National Park, and La Amistad International Peace Park are three protected areas in the region.
